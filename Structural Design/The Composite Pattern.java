The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is useful when dealing with hierarchical structures where individual objects and compositions of those objects need to be treated in a consistent manner.

The key components of the Composite Pattern are:

1. **Component:** This is the common interface or base class for both leaf and composite objects. It defines methods that are applicable to both individual objects and composite objects.

2. **Leaf:** This represents individual objects that don't have any children. Leaf objects implement the methods defined in the Component interface.

3. **Composite:** This is an object that can have child components. Composite objects implement the methods from the Component interface but also manage a collection of child components.

Now, let's implement the Composite Pattern in Java using a simple example of a company's organization structure.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component interface
interface Employee {
    void showDetails();
}

// Leaf: Individual Employee
class Developer implements Employee {
    private String name;
    private String position;

    public Developer(String name, String position) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Position: " + position);
    }
}

// Composite: Manager with a team of employees
class Manager implements Employee {
    private String name;
    private String position;
    private List<Employee> team = new ArrayList<>();

    public Manager(String name, String position) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
    }

    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        team.add(employee);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Position: " + position);
        System.out.println("Team:");
        for (Employee employee : team) {
            employee.showDetails();
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee developer1 = new Developer("Alice", "Software Developer");
        Employee developer2 = new Developer("Bob", "Software Developer");

        Manager manager = new Manager("Eve", "Development Manager");
        manager.addEmployee(developer1);
        manager.addEmployee(developer2);

        manager.showDetails();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Employee` interface acts as the Component. `Developer` is a Leaf that represents individual employees, and `Manager` is a Composite that can have a team of employees. The `Manager` class can hold a collection of both individual developers and other managers, forming a hierarchical structure.

By using the Composite Pattern, you can treat individual employees and managers uniformly through the `Employee` interface, regardless of whether they are leaf nodes or composite nodes. This makes it easier to work with complex hierarchical structures and simplifies the client code that interacts with them.

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, allowing clients to work with them in the same way.

Here's a step-by-step implementation of the Composite Pattern in Java:

1. Define the component interface that declares the common operations for both leaf and composite objects.
```java
public interface Component {
    void operation();
}
```
2. Implement the leaf class that represents the primitive objects in the hierarchy.
```java
public class Leaf implements Component {
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        // Perform the operation for leaf objects
    }
}
```
3. Implement the composite class that represents the composite objects in the hierarchy. It maintains a collection of child components and implements the operations by iterating over the collection and invoking the appropriate methods for each component.
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Composite implements Component {
    private List<Component> components = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void add(Component component) {
        components.add(component);
    }
    
    public void remove(Component component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        // Perform the operation for composite objects
        for (Component component : components) {
            component.operation();
        }
    }
}
```
4. Use the composite and leaf objects in the client code.
```java
public class CompositePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Component leaf1 = new Leaf();
        Component leaf2 = new Leaf();
        
        Composite composite1 = new Composite();
        composite1.add(leaf1);
        composite1.add(leaf2);
        
        Component leaf3 = new Leaf();
        
        Composite composite2 = new Composite();
        composite2.add(leaf3);
        composite2.add(composite1);
        
        composite2.operation();
    }
}
```
In this example:

- The `Component` interface declares the common operations for both leaf and composite objects.
- The `Leaf` class represents the primitive objects in the hierarchy. It implements the `operation()` method specific to leaf objects.
- The `Composite` class represents the composite objects in the hierarchy. It maintains a collection of child components and implements the `operation()` method by iterating over the collection and invoking the `operation()` method for each component.
- In the `CompositePatternDemo` main method, we create instances of the leaf and composite objects. We add the leaf objects to a composite object and then add the composite object to another composite object. Finally, we call the `operation()` method on the top-level composite object, which internally calls the `operation()` method on all the child components.

The Composite Pattern allows you to create complex tree-like structures and treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is useful when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies and perform operations on them uniformly [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/java-composite-pattern), [Source 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/composite-design-pattern-in-java), [Source 9](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2074564/a-look-at-the-composite-design-pattern.html), [Source 11](https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/when-use-composite-design-pattern-java).
