The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making it possible for them to collaborate without changing their source code. This pattern is useful when you have an existing class or system that you want to reuse, but its interface doesn't match the requirements of the client code.

The key components of the Adapter Pattern are:

1. **Target Interface:** This is the interface that the client code expects to interact with.

2. **Adaptee:** This is the existing class or object that has an incompatible interface and needs to be integrated into the client code.

3. **Adapter:** This is the class that bridges the gap between the Target Interface and the Adaptee. It implements the Target Interface and internally uses the Adaptee's methods to fulfill the required functionality.

Now, let's implement the Adapter Pattern in Java using a simple example. Imagine you have an application that works with an existing `LegacyLibrary` class, which has a method named `legacyMethod()` that you want to use within a new `ModernInterface`. However, the `LegacyLibrary`'s method signature doesn't match the requirements of the `ModernInterface`.

```java
// Legacy Library with incompatible interface
class LegacyLibrary {
    void legacyMethod() {
        System.out.println("Legacy method called.");
    }
}

// Modern Interface expected by the client code
interface ModernInterface {
    void modernMethod();
}

// Adapter class that adapts LegacyLibrary to ModernInterface
class LegacyAdapter implements ModernInterface {
    private LegacyLibrary adaptee;

    public LegacyAdapter(LegacyLibrary adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void modernMethod() {
        adaptee.legacyMethod(); // Using LegacyLibrary's method within ModernInterface
    }
}

// Client code using the ModernInterface
class ClientCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LegacyLibrary legacyLibrary = new LegacyLibrary();
        ModernInterface adapter = new LegacyAdapter(legacyLibrary);

        adapter.modernMethod(); // This will call the legacyMethod through the adapter
    }
}
```

In this example, `LegacyAdapter` acts as an adapter between the `LegacyLibrary` and the `ModernInterface`. It takes an instance of `LegacyLibrary` as a parameter and implements the `ModernInterface`. When the `modernMethod()` is called on the adapter, it internally delegates the call to the `legacyMethod()` of the `LegacyLibrary`.

This way, the client code can work with the `ModernInterface` without needing to modify the existing `LegacyLibrary` class, making it easier to integrate legacy code into new systems or interfaces.

  The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect.

Here's a step-by-step implementation of the Adapter Pattern in Java:

1. Identify the interfaces that are incompatible and need to be adapted.
2. Create the Target interface that the client expects to work with.
```java
public interface Target {
    void request();
}
```
3. Implement the Adaptee class that has the incompatible interface.
```java
public class Adaptee {
    public void specificRequest() {
        // Perform specific request
    }
}
```
4. Create the Adapter class that implements the Target interface and wraps the Adaptee.
```java
public class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;
    
    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}
```
5. Use the Adapter in the client code.
```java
public class AdapterPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        Target target = new Adapter(adaptee);
        
        target.request();
    }
}
```
In this example:

- The `Target` interface defines the interface that the client expects to work with.
- The `Adaptee` class has the incompatible interface that needs to be adapted.
- The `Adapter` class implements the `Target` interface and wraps the `Adaptee`. It delegates the request from the `Target` interface to the `specificRequest()` method of the `Adaptee`.
- In the `AdapterPatternDemo` main method, we create an instance of the `Adaptee`, create an instance of the `Adapter` and pass the `Adaptee` to it. We then use the `Target` interface to make a request, which is internally handled by the `Adapter` and delegated to the `Adaptee`.

The Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a common interface that clients can use. It is useful when you want to reuse existing classes with incompatible interfaces or integrate third-party libraries with your code [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/java-adapter-pattern), [Source 10](https://www.javadevjournal.com/java-design-patterns/adapter-design-pattern/), [Source 11](https://dzone.com/articles/adapter-design-pattern-in-java).
