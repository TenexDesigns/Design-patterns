Certainly! Here's a list of the 23 classic design patterns categorized into the three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral, as introduced by the Gang of Four:

**Creational Design Patterns:**
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
2. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
3. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
4. **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object's properties, avoiding the need to create new instances from scratch.
5. **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

**Structural Design Patterns:**
These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures.

6. **Adapter**: Converts the interface of one class into another interface clients expect. Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
7. **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
8. **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
9. **Decorator**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
10. **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.
11. **Flyweight**: Shares objects to reduce memory usage by reusing common parts of the object across multiple instances.
12. **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access, add behavior, or defer instantiation.

**Behavioral Design Patterns:**
These patterns deal with object collaboration, responsibilities, and algorithms.

13. **Chain of Responsibility**: Creates a chain of handler objects for a request, allowing the request to be handled by different handlers in the chain.
14. **Command**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. Allows parameterization of clients with different requests.
15. **Interpreter**: Defines a grammar for a language and an interpreter to interpret the language expressions.
16. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation. Facilitates traversal of collections.
17. **Mediator**: Defines a central mediator object that encapsulates communication between objects. Promotes loose coupling between objects.
18. **Memento**: Captures an object's internal state and saves it externally so that the object can be restored to that state later.
19. **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
20. **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. Encapsulates different behaviors as separate classes.
21. **Strategy**: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and lets them be used interchangeably within a context.
22. **Template Method**: Defines the structure of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps.
23. **Visitor**: Separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. Allows adding new operations to objects without modifying their classes.

These 23 design patterns collectively form a comprehensive set of solutions to recurring design problems in software development. Each pattern addresses a specific concern,
and by understanding and applying these patterns appropriately, developers can create more maintainable, flexible, and modular software systems.

  The 23 classic design patterns, as cataloged by the Gang of Four, fall into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. 

- **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. The Creational patterns include: 

    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Factory Method
    - Prototype
    - Singleton

- **Structural Patterns**: These patterns concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality. The Structural patterns include: 

    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy
    
  [Source 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

- **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects, how they interact and distribute responsibility. The Behavioral patterns include:

    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor

These design patterns provide solutions to common design issues in object-oriented programming. They represent best practices and can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms [Source 0](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns).
