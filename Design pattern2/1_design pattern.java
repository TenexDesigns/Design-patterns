A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It's a proven way to address a specific type of challenge while creating well-structured, maintainable, and efficient code. Design patterns are not complete implementations, but rather templates that you can adapt and customize to fit your specific application.

There are 23 classic design patterns that were cataloged by the "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) in their book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software." These patterns are grouped into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

Here's a brief overview of each category with one example from each, explained using Java code samples:

**1. Creational Design Patterns:**
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
  
  ```java
  interface Product {
      void operation();
  }

  class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
      public void operation() {
          System.out.println("ConcreteProductA operation");
      }
  }

  abstract class Creator {
      abstract Product factoryMethod();
  }

  class ConcreteCreatorA extends Creator {
      Product factoryMethod() {
          return new ConcreteProductA();
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Creator creator = new ConcreteCreatorA();
          Product product = creator.factoryMethod();
          product.operation();  // Output: ConcreteProductA operation
      }
  }
  ```

**2. Structural Design Patterns:**
These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures.

- **Adapter Pattern**: Converts the interface of one class into another interface clients expect. Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
  
  ```java
  interface Target {
      void request();
  }

  class Adaptee {
      void specificRequest() {
          System.out.println("Adaptee specificRequest");
      }
  }

  class Adapter implements Target {
      private Adaptee adaptee;

      Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
          this.adaptee = adaptee;
      }

      public void request() {
          adaptee.specificRequest();
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
          Target target = new Adapter(adaptee);
          target.request();  // Output: Adaptee specificRequest
      }
  }
  ```

**3. Behavioral Design Patterns:**
These patterns deal with object collaboration, responsibilities, and algorithms.

- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  
  ```java
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.List;

  interface Observer {
      void update(String message);
  }

  class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
      private String name;

      ConcreteObserver(String name) {
          this.name = name;
      }

      public void update(String message) {
          System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message);
      }
  }

  class Subject {
      private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
      private String state;

      void attach(Observer observer) {
          observers.add(observer);
      }

      void detach(Observer observer) {
          observers.remove(observer);
      }

      void setState(String state) {
          this.state = state;
          notifyObservers();
      }

      private void notifyObservers() {
          for (Observer observer : observers) {
              observer.update(state);
          }
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 1");
          ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 2");

          Subject subject = new Subject();
          subject.attach(observer1);
          subject.attach(observer2);

          subject.setState("New State");  
          // Output:
          // Observer 1 received message: New State
          // Observer 2 received message: New State
      }
  }
  ```

These are just basic examples to introduce the concepts of each design pattern. Design patterns are versatile and can be applied in various contexts to solve specific problems. It's important to choose the appropriate design pattern based on the problem you're trying to solve and the specific requirements of your project.
