The most important and most commonly used design patterns are:

* **Creational patterns:** These patterns provide ways to create objects in a flexible and reusable way. Some of the most common creational patterns include:
    * **Singleton:** This pattern ensures that there is only one instance of a class and provides a global point of access to that instance.
    * **Factory method:** This pattern allows you to defer the creation of objects to subclasses.
    * **Abstract factory:** This pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying the concrete classes of the objects that will be created.
    * **Builder:** This pattern allows you to construct complex objects step-by-step.

* **Structural patterns:** These patterns provide ways to organize classes and objects into larger structures. Some of the most common structural patterns include:
    * **Adapter:** This pattern allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another.
    * **Bridge:** This pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
    * **Composite:** This pattern allows you to create tree structures of objects and treat them as a single object.
    * **Decorator:** This pattern allows you to add new functionality to existing objects without modifying their classes.

* **Behavioral patterns:** These patterns provide ways to coordinate the behavior of objects. Some of the most common behavioral patterns include:
    * **Command:** This pattern allows you to encapsulate a request as an object so that it can be parameterized, queued, or logged.
    * **Observer:** This pattern allows objects to be notified of changes to other objects.
    * **State:** This pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
    * **Strategy:** This pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

Which design patterns are the most beneficial to learn depends on the specific needs of your project. However, the patterns listed above are a good place to start, as they are some of the most common and widely used design patterns.

Here are some examples of how design patterns can be used in different areas:

* **Creational patterns:** The singleton pattern can be used to create a global database connection, while the factory method pattern can be used to create different types of database connections.
* **Structural patterns:** The adapter pattern can be used to connect a legacy system to a new system, while the bridge pattern can be used to decouple a UI from its implementation.
* **Behavioral patterns:** The command pattern can be used to implement undo/redo functionality, while the observer pattern can be used to implement a notification system.

It is important to note that design patterns should not be used blindly. They should be used to solve specific problems in your code. If you are not sure whether or not a design pattern is appropriate for a given situation, it is best to err on the side of caution and not use it.
