The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and restore an object's internal state without exposing its internal structure. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to implement features like undo/redo functionality or provide a way to save and restore an object's state.

Here's how the Memento pattern works:

1. **Originator**: This is the object whose state you want to capture. It has a method to create a Memento object that represents its current state, and another method to restore its state from a Memento object.

2. **Memento**: This is an object that stores the state of the Originator at a particular point in time. It should have methods to retrieve the state and possibly other relevant information.

3. **Caretaker**: This object is responsible for keeping track of the Memento objects. It can store them in a list (to implement undo/redo functionality) or use any other suitable data structure.

Let's implement the Memento pattern in Java:

```java
// Originator
class Originator {
    private String state;

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public Memento createMemento() {
        return new Memento(state);
    }

    public void restoreMemento(Memento memento) {
        state = memento.getState();
    }
}

// Memento
class Memento {
    private final String state;

    public Memento(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}

// Caretaker
class Caretaker {
    private Memento memento;

    public void saveMemento(Memento memento) {
        this.memento = memento;
    }

    public Memento getMemento() {
        return memento;
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Originator originator = new Originator();
        Caretaker caretaker = new Caretaker();

        originator.setState("State 1");
        caretaker.saveMemento(originator.createMemento());

        originator.setState("State 2");
        caretaker.saveMemento(originator.createMemento());

        // Restore to the first state
        originator.restoreMemento(caretaker.getMemento());
        System.out.println("Current state: " + originator.getState());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Originator` is a class that has a state which can be set and retrieved. It can also create and restore `Memento` objects. The `Caretaker` class keeps track of the `Memento` objects and can be used to restore the state of the `Originator`.

Remember, the Memento pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to provide an undo/redo mechanism or save and restore object states without exposing their internal details.

  The Memento Design Pattern, as described by the Gang of Four, is a behavioral design pattern that offers a solution to implement undoable actions. This is achieved by saving the state of an object at a given instant and restoring it if the actions performed since need to be undone [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/java-memento-design-pattern).

The Memento pattern involves three key components:

1. **Originator**: This is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It creates the memento and uses it in the future to undo the state [Source 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memento-design-pattern/).

2. **Memento**: This object maintains the state of the Originator. It is essentially a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that encapsulates the internal state of the Originator [Source 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memento-design-pattern/).

3. **Caretaker**: This object keeps track of multiple mementos and triggers the save and restore of the state in the Originator [Source 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memento-design-pattern/).

Now, let's see a step-by-step implementation of the Memento Design Pattern in Java using a text editor example.

```java
// Originator
public class TextWindow {
    private StringBuilder currentText;
    public TextWindow() {
        this.currentText = new StringBuilder();
    }
    public void addText(String text) {
        currentText.append(text);
    }
    public Memento save() {
        return new Memento(currentText.toString());
    }
    public void restore(Memento memento) {
        this.currentText = new StringBuilder(memento.getSavedText());
    }
}

// Memento
public class Memento {
    private final String text;
    public Memento(String textToSave) {
        text = textToSave;
    }
    public String getSavedText() {
        return text;
    }
}

// Caretaker
public class TextEditor {
    private TextWindow textWindow;
    private Stack<Memento> textSnapshots = new Stack<>();
    public TextEditor(TextWindow textWindow) {
        this.textWindow = textWindow;
    }
    public void write(String text) {
        textWindow.addText(text);
        textSnapshots.push(textWindow.save());
    }
    public void undo() {
        if(!textSnapshots.isEmpty()) {
            textWindow.restore(textSnapshots.pop());
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code:

- The `TextWindow` class (Originator) has a `save` method that creates a new `Memento` object and a `restore` method that restores its state from a `Memento` object.
- The `Memento` class is a simple immutable object that holds the state of the `TextWindow` object.
- The `TextEditor` class (Caretaker) uses a `Stack` to keep track of multiple `Memento` objects for undo functionality [Source 6](https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-memento).

This pattern allows you to save snapshots of the application's state and restore it later, all while keeping the details of the state encapsulation within the Originator [Source 3](https://howtodoinjava.com/design-patterns/behavioral/memento-design-pattern/). However, there are some challenges such as increased memory usage and maintenance costs, and decreased overall performance due to the additional time to save the states [Source 3](https://howtodoinjava.com/design
