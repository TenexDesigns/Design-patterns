The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in a superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It's useful when you have a common algorithm that needs to be customized by different subclasses.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Template Method:** An abstract class that defines the basic structure of an algorithm as a series of steps. Some steps may have default implementations, while others are marked as abstract and need to be implemented by subclasses.

2. **Concrete Classes:** Subclasses that extend the template method and provide implementations for the abstract steps. They can also override or extend the default steps if necessary.

**Example of Template Method Pattern:**

Let's consider a template for making different types of beverages. The basic process is the same (boil water, brew, pour into a cup), but the specific steps for brewing tea and coffee can vary. Here's how the Template Method Pattern can be applied:

```java
// Template Method
abstract class BeverageTemplate {
    // The template method that defines the algorithm structure
    final void prepareBeverage() {
        boilWater();
        brew();
        pourInCup();
        addCondiments();
    }

    // These steps are common for all beverages
    void boilWater() {
        System.out.println("Boiling water");
    }

    void pourInCup() {
        System.out.println("Pouring into cup");
    }

    // These steps will be implemented by subclasses
    abstract void brew();

    abstract void addCondiments();
}

// Concrete Classes
class Tea extends BeverageTemplate {
    void brew() {
        System.out.println("Steeping the tea");
    }

    void addCondiments() {
        System.out.println("Adding lemon");
    }
}

class Coffee extends BeverageTemplate {
    void brew() {
        System.out.println("Dripping coffee through filter");
    }

    void addCondiments() {
        System.out.println("Adding sugar and milk");
    }
}

// Client Code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeverageTemplate tea = new Tea();
        tea.prepareBeverage();

        System.out.println();

        BeverageTemplate coffee = new Coffee();
        coffee.prepareBeverage();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `BeverageTemplate` class defines the overall structure of preparing a beverage. The common steps like boiling water and pouring into a cup are implemented in the template method. Subclasses `Tea` and `Coffee` provide specific implementations for the `brew` and `addCondiments` steps.

The Template Method Pattern is beneficial when you want to enforce a common algorithmic structure while allowing for variations in certain steps. It promotes code reuse and makes it easier to add new variations of the algorithm without modifying the overall structure.

# The Template Method Pattern in Java

## Introduction

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It is particularly useful when you have several classes with similar algorithms that have minor differences. By using this pattern, you can avoid code duplication and ensure the structure of the algorithm remains intact [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/java-template-method-pattern), [Source 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/template-method-design-pattern-in-java), [Source 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/template-method-design-pattern/).

## Implementation

To implement the Template Method pattern in Java, you typically create an abstract base class that contains a method known as the template method. This method outlines the structure of the algorithm, calling on a series of other methods in a specific order. Some of these methods are implemented in the base class, while others are left abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. 

Here is a simple example of implementing the Template Method pattern in Java:

```java
public abstract class ComputerBuilder {
    
    public final Computer buildComputer() {
        addMotherboard();
        setupMotherboard();
        addProcessor();
        return new Computer(computerParts);
    }
   
    public abstract void addMotherboard();
    public abstract void setupMotherboard();
    public abstract void addProcessor();
}
```

In this example, `ComputerBuilder` is an abstract class that outlines the steps required to build a computer. The `buildComputer()` method is the template method, which calls on the `addMotherboard()`, `setupMotherboard()`, and `addProcessor()` methods in a specific order. These methods are left abstract, meaning they must be implemented by any class that extends `ComputerBuilder` [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/java-template-method-pattern). 

## Usage

The Template Method pattern is widely used in the Java core libraries. For example, the `addAll()` method in `java.util.AbstractList` is an example of a template method. It provides a general algorithm for adding all elements from one collection to another, while the `add()` method, which is called by `addAll()`, is left abstract and must be implemented by subclasses [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/java-template-method-pattern).

The Template Method pattern is useful when you want to provide a defined algorithm while allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for some steps. It promotes code reuse, reduces code duplication, and improves code readability. However, caution should be taken as it can lead to high complexity when there are many steps or many subclasses [Source 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/template-method-design-pattern-in-java). 

In conclusion, the Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for providing a defined algorithm structure while allowing for flexibility in how some of the steps are implemented. It is widely used in Java and can be a useful tool in your design pattern arsenal [Source 4](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method/java/example).
