In Java, abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance are three key concepts used in object-oriented programming (OOP) for structuring and organizing code. Each has its own purpose and use cases:

**1. Abstract Classes:**

- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (you can't create objects directly from it).
- It serves as a blueprint for other classes and allows you to define common methods and fields that will be shared by its subclasses.
- Abstract classes can have both abstract (methods without a body, to be implemented by subclasses) and concrete methods (with a body).
- Subclasses of an abstract class are required to implement all the abstract methods, or they themselves must be declared as abstract classes.

Example:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method
    void eat() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}
```

**2. Interfaces:**

- An interface is like a contract or a set of rules that a class agrees to follow.
- Unlike abstract classes, interfaces can't have concrete methods (methods with a body). They can only have method signatures.
- A class can implement multiple interfaces, enabling it to inherit behavior from multiple sources.
- Interfaces are used to achieve "multiple inheritance" in Java since a class can extend only one class but implement multiple interfaces.

Example:

```java
interface Shape {
    double area(); // Method signature (no body)
    double perimeter(); // Method signature (no body)
}
```

**3. Inheritance:**

- Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (subclass or derived class) is created by inheriting properties and behaviors (methods and fields) from an existing class (superclass or base class).
- Java supports single inheritance for classes, meaning a class can extend only one other class.
- However, Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

Example:

```java
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    double width, height;

    Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }

    @Override
    public double perimeter() {
        return 2 * (width + height);
    }
}
```

**When to Use Each:**

- Use an abstract class when you want to provide a common base with some default implementation for your subclasses.
- Use an interface when you want to define a contract that multiple classes can implement, allowing them to have a common set of methods.
- Use inheritance when you want to create a new class that extends the functionality of an existing class, reusing and possibly overriding its methods.

It's important to choose the right tool (abstract class, interface, or inheritance) for the specific problem you're trying to solve in your Java application. Each has its own strengths and use cases.
