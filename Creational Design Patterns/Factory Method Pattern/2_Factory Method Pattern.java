# Factory Method Pattern in Java

## Introduction

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created [Source 1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-factory-pattern), [Source 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern). 

This pattern is often used when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create or when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates [Source 3](https://www.javatpoint.com/factory-method-design-pattern). 

The Factory Method pattern is also known as the Virtual Constructor [Source 3](https://www.javatpoint.com/factory-method-design-pattern).

## Implementation

To implement the Factory Method pattern in Java, you would:

1. Define an interface or abstract class for creating an object.
2. Let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Here's a simple example:

```java
public abstract class Fruit {
    // some methods
}

public class Apple extends Fruit {
    // some methods
}

public class Orange extends Fruit {
    // some methods
}

public abstract class FruitFactory {
    public abstract Fruit createFruit();
}

public class AppleFactory extends FruitFactory {
    @Override
    public Fruit createFruit() {
        return new Apple();
    }
}

public class OrangeFactory extends FruitFactory {
    @Override
    public Fruit createFruit() {
        return new Orange();
    }
}
```

In this example, `FruitFactory` is an abstract class that declares the `createFruit` method. The `AppleFactory` and `OrangeFactory` classes extend `FruitFactory` and provide their own implementations of the `createFruit` method [Source 10](https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-factory), [Source 11](https://howtodoinjava.com/design-patterns/creational/implementing-factory-design-pattern-in-java/).

## Considerations in Multithreaded Environments

The Factory Method pattern can be used in both single-threaded and multithreaded environments. This pattern does not have any inherent issues with multithreading as it does not rely on any shared state. However, if the objects being created by the factory are not thread-safe, extra care must be taken when using these objects in a multithreaded environment [Source 16](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13029261/design-patterns-factory-vs-factory-method-vs-abstract-factory).

## Features and Best Practices

The Factory Method pattern is often used when:

- A class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
- Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate [Source 5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30304828/what-is-factory-method-in-java).

The Factory Method pattern helps to keep the creation logic of an object in one place, which adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain [Source 15](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/factory-method-vs-factory-vs-abstract-factory).

However, this pattern can lead to complexity and can add unnecessary layers in the code if the type of objects being created is not likely to change in the future. It is best to use this pattern when there is a clear need for flexibility and extensibility in the code [Source 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/factory-design-pattern-in-java).

The Factory Method pattern should not be confused with the Simple Factory idiom or the Abstract Factory pattern. The Simple Factory idiom is a simpler version of the Factory Method pattern that does not use inheritance, while the Abstract Factory pattern is used to create families of related objects [Source 15](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/factory-method-vs-factory-vs-abstract-factory), [Source 16](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13029261/design-patterns-factory-vs-factory-method-vs-abstract-factory).
