**Factory Method Pattern:**

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It defines an abstract method for creating objects, which subclasses implement to produce objects with specific behaviors.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Factory Method:** An abstract method declared in the superclass, responsible for creating objects. Subclasses override this method to provide specific implementations.
2. **Concrete Products:** These are the actual objects that the Factory Method creates. Subclasses of the creator class provide implementations for these products.
3. **Creator:** The superclass that declares the Factory Method and defines the structure for object creation. It can also include common logic for working with products.
4. **Concrete Creators:** Subclasses of the Creator that implement the Factory Method to create specific instances of products.
5. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class should have a single reason to change. In the context of the Factory Method, this principle encourages separating object creation from the client code that uses the objects.
6. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. Factory Method follows this principle by allowing new product types to be added without modifying existing creator classes.

**Usage and Benefits:**
- The Factory Method Pattern is used when you want to create objects but you don't know their exact classes at compile time.
- It provides a way to encapsulate object creation and allow subclasses to define which classes to instantiate.
- It promotes loose coupling between client code and the specific types of objects being created.

**Implementation in Multi-threaded and Non-multi-threaded Environments:**
The Factory Method implementation can vary based on the threading environment, but the core principles remain the same. Thread safety considerations are important, especially if you're sharing factories or product instances between threads. You might need to add synchronization mechanisms to ensure proper behavior in a multi-threaded environment.

**Example:**

Let's implement a Factory Method Pattern for a simplified scenario of creating different types of documents:

```java
// Product
interface Document {
    void open();
}

// Concrete Products
class TextDocument implements Document {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening a text document.");
    }
}

class PDFDocument implements Document {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening a PDF document.");
    }
}

// Creator
abstract class DocumentCreator {
    public abstract Document createDocument();
}

// Concrete Creators
class TextDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
    public Document createDocument() {
        return new TextDocument();
    }
}

class PDFDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
    public Document createDocument() {
        return new PDFDocument();
    }
}

// Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DocumentCreator creator = new TextDocumentCreator();
        Document document = creator.createDocument();
        document.open();
    }
}
```

**Abstract Factory Pattern (Briefly):**

The Abstract Factory Pattern extends the Factory Method Pattern. It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. In other words, it encapsulates multiple Factory Methods.

For example, an Abstract Factory could create different types of UI elements like buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, ensuring that they are consistent in appearance and behavior.

Implementing the Abstract Factory Pattern is more complex and involves creating multiple hierarchies of related factories and products. If you're interested, I can provide more details and code examples.
