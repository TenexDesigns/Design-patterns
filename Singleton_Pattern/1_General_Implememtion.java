The Singleton pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to control access to a single instance of a class, such as managing a connection pool, configuration settings, or a cache.

**Key Points about Singleton:**
1. **Single Instance:** It ensures that there is only one instance of the class throughout the application's lifecycle.
2. **Global Access:** It provides a global point of access to that single instance.
3. **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is created only when it's needed, not at the time of class loading.
4. **Thread Safety:** Singleton implementation should consider thread safety to ensure proper functioning in a multithreaded environment.

**Steps to Implement Singleton:**

Here's a basic example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation.
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**Considerations for Multithreaded vs. Non-Multithreaded Environments:**

1. **Non-Multithreaded Environment:**
   In a single-threaded environment, the basic lazy initialization Singleton is sufficient.

2. **Multithreaded Environment:**
   In a multithreaded environment, the basic lazy initialization Singleton is not thread-safe. Multiple threads might simultaneously access the `getInstance` method and create multiple instances. To ensure thread safety, there are a few approaches:

   **a. Synchronized Method:**
   One way to achieve thread safety is to make the `getInstance` method synchronized. This prevents multiple threads from concurrently creating instances. However, synchronization can introduce performance overhead.

   ```java
   public synchronized static Singleton getInstance() {
       if (instance == null) {
           instance = new Singleton();
       }
       return instance;
   }
   ```

   **b. Double-Checked Locking:**
   A more efficient approach is to use double-checked locking with volatile keyword (Java 5+). It checks for null before acquiring the lock, reducing synchronization overhead after the instance is created.

   ```java
   public static Singleton getInstance() {
       if (instance == null) {
           synchronized (Singleton.class) {
               if (instance == null) {
                   instance = new Singleton();
               }
           }
       }
       return instance;
   }
   ```

**Where to Use Singleton:**
Singleton is useful in scenarios where having multiple instances of a class doesn't make sense, such as:
- Database connection pool management.
- Logger instances.
- Configuration managers.
- Caching mechanisms.

However, be cautious when using the Singleton pattern, as it can introduce tight coupling between classes and make testing more difficult due to global state. Consider using dependency injection or other patterns in cases where you need more flexibility.

Remember, while the Singleton pattern can be useful, overusing it can lead to code that is hard to maintain and test.
